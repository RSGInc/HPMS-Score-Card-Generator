This package requires that java be installed but otherwise has no special
installation requirements.  In particular, the package includes a copy of H2 
so H2 need not be separately installed.

If do you wish to use a version of H2 other than the one included in the 
package then do something like this (or place the option statement in your 
.Rprofile file).

	library(RH2)
	options(RH2.jars = "C:/tmp2/h2-1.3.154.jar")
