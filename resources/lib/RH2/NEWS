o H2 has a jars argument that can be used to pass the jar for an alternate
  version of H2.  By default it uses the value of the option "RH2.jars" or the
  H2 jar that comes with RH2 if that option is not specified.  e.g.
	  options(RH2.jars = "c:/tmp2/h2-1.3.155.jar")

o dbConnect has a DATABASE_TO_UPPER argument.  If FALSE then identifiers
  are not automatically translated to upper case.  It defaults to option
  "RH2.DATABASE_TO_UPPER" or if that is not set it defaults to FALSE.
  (The undocumented h2.identifiersToUpper java parameter that was supported on 
  earlier versions of H2 for this purpose is no longer used by H2.)
