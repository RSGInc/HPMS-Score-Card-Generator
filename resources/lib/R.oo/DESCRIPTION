Description: Methods and classes for object-oriented programming in R with or without references.  Large effort has been made on making definition of methods as simple as possible with a minimum of maintenance for package developers.  The package has been developed since 2001 and is now considered very stable.  This is a cross-platform package implemented in pure R that defines standard S3 classes without any tricks.
