 NEWS for fastmatch

    o	some R functions (such as subset assignment like x[1] <- 2)
	can create a new object (with possibly modified content) and
	copy all attributes including the hash cache. If the original
	object was used as a table in fmatch(), the hash cache will be
	copied into the modified object and thus its cache will be
	possibly out of	sync with the object. fmatch() will now
	identify such cases and discard the hash to prevent errorneous
	results.

    o	match() coerces POSIXlt objects into characters, but so far 
	fmatch() performed the match on the actual objects.
	Now fmatch() coerces POSIXlt object into characters just like
	match(), but note that you will lose the ability to perform
	fast lookups if the table is a POSIXlt object -- please use
	POSIXct objects (much more efficient) or use as.character() on
	the POSIXlt object to create a table that you want to re-use.
